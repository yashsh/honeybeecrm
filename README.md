Contact management and Social CRM for busy professionals

As many of us, I try to do networking and try to keep in touch with my contacts. However, in our busy lives, we forget to follow up with folks, keep in touch, or just a better, more efficient way to do that.

HoneyBee CRM grew out of that need and allows users to link their social networks like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and their contacts so that they can manage and keep in touch with these contacts all in one place. HoneyBee CRM also provides automatic alerts and reminders for following up with contacts.

Lets make our networking lives easier!

Hope this is as useful to you as it for me. Thanks for checking it out.
